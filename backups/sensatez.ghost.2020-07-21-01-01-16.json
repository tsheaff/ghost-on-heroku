You can also get started with our\nuseful starter theme [https://github.com/TryGhost/Starter/], which includes the\nmost common foundations and components required to build your own theme.\n\n> If you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or\nhelp, there's also a themes section on our public Ghost forum\n[https://forum.ghost.org/c/themes].","feature_image":"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/creating-a-custom-theme.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2020-07-21T00:58:40.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-21T00:58:40.000Z","published_at":"2020-07-21T00:58:40.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Ghost comes with a beautiful default theme designed for publishers which can easily be adapted for most purposes, or you can build a custom theme to suit your needs.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f163dc1a8c266003b6de921","uuid":"16dfdec8-a5b0-4f5c-9cde-6ec4bc6c5d93","title":"Apps & integrations","slug":"apps-integrations","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/integrations-icons.png\",\"cardWidth\":\"full\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<script src=\\\"https://zapier.com/apps/embed/widget.js?services=Ghost&container=true&limit=8\\\"></script>\\n\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v3.0.0/images/integrations-and-webhooks-in-ghost.png\",\"alt\":\"Screenshot of custom integrations with webhooks in Ghost Admin\",\"cardWidth\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/integrations/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://zapier.com\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/docs/api/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"/themes/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Work with your existing tools\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It's possible to connect your Ghost site to hundreds of the most popular apps and tools using integrations that take no more than a few minutes to setup.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Whether you need to automate workflows, connect your email list, build a community or embed products from your ecommerce store, our \"],[0,[0],1,\"integrations library\"],[0,[],0,\" has got it all covered with hundreds of tutorials.\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Zapier\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"On top of this, you can connect your Ghost site to more than 1,000 external services using the official integration with \"],[0,[1],1,\"Zapier\"],[0,[],0,\".\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Zapier sets up automations with Triggers and Actions, which allows you to create and customise a wide range of connected applications.\"]]],[1,\"blockquote\",[[0,[2],1,\"Example\"],[0,[],0,\": When someone new subscribes to a newsletter on a Ghost site (Trigger) then the contact information is automatically pushed into MailChimp (Action).\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[2],1,\"Here are the most popular Ghost<>Zapier automation templates:\"],[0,[],0,\" \"]]],[10,1],[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Custom integrations\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"At the heart of Ghost sits a robust JSON API – designed to create, manage and retrieve content with ease. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It's possible to create custom Ghost integrations with dedicated API keys and webhooks from the Integrations page within Ghost Admin. \"]]],[10,2],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Beyond that, the API allows you to build entirely custom publishing apps.

Embed code blocks directly \n\n<header class=\"site-header outer\">\n    <div class=\"inner\">\n        {{> \"site-nav\"}}\n    </div>\n</header>\n\nIt's also possible to share links from across the web in a visual way using\nbookmark cards that automatically render information from a websites meta data.\nPaste any URL to try it out: \n\nGhost: The #1 open source headless Node.js CMSThe world’s most popular modern\nopen source publishing platform.

And on top of that,\npowerful forces like Twitter's character limit and the 24-hour news cycle mean\nthat our culture is often incredibly shallow — our conversations on important\nissues often lack emotional and intellectual depth.\n\nStoic philosophy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism] offers a deep, rich\nand time-tested antidote to these ills.\n\nA Stoic Circle is a small intentional community of 6-8 people that meets each\nweek to discuss a single principle from the Stoic philosophers. We seek to apply\nthe lessons of the Stoics into our own lives. Part group therapy, part\nphilosophy discussion, part self-help circle, it’s an intentional community that\nstrives to go beneath the surface to get at the deep emotional issues we face in\nour lives.\n\nValues inside the Circle\nWhen we enter the circle each week, we choose to embody the following values:\n\n * Self-improvement — We strive to improve ourselves. We actively encourage this\n   mindset in those around us. We seek to avoid negative or unproductive thought\n   patterns and recognize that growth is a never-ending game.\n * Openness — We value honesty and transparency, and are willing to speak\n   frankly about our own inner lives. We try to look deeply within ourselves in\n   order to recognize, articulate and share our own insecurities, weaknesses and\n   self-doubts, as well as our inner triumphs and victories over fear.\n\nFormat of the Circle\nA Stoic Circle consists of a 1 hour meeting per week for 6 weeks. For now this\nwill be on Zoom to facilitate social distancing.\n\nEach week we will discuss a single short excerpt from the Stoic philosophers,\nand a few related prompts to provoke discussion. Here is the six week syllabus:\n\nWeek I — Avoiding outrage\n> Choose not to be harmed — and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed — and you\nhaven’t been.~ Marcus Aurelius\n * Have you observed any negative impacts in your life from the emotion of\n   outrage?\n * Outrage is addictive. What habits or behaviors do you engage in that provoke\n   your outrage? What are some techniques for avoiding this?\n\nWeek II — Self-discipline\n> Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.~ Marcus Aurelius\n * It's easy to look out at the world and cast judgement. Have you found\n   yourself able to resist this urge? If so, have you found this to be\n   beneficial?\n * Share a story of a time when you managed to stay disciplined towards a\n   healthy intention you set, and how this improved your life.\n\nWeek III — The value of time\n> People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes\nto squandering time they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right\nto be stingy.~ Seneca\n * Are there areas of your life you're spending more time on than you think\n   ideal? Do you suffer from any addictions or compulsions that eat away at your\n   time but that you're unable to abstain from?\n * What approaches do you have for evaluating whether different activities are\n   worth your time?\n\nWeek IV — Facing mortality\n> You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and\nthink.~ Marcus Aurelius\n> He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a man who is alive.~ Seneca\n * How have you integrated the knowledge of your own mortality into your life?\n   Has this been a positive or negative experience?\n * Do you fear death? If so, are you able to introspect deeper to understand\n   what you truly fear? For example, perhaps you fear being forgotten by the\n   world, or you fear the uncertainty of an afterlife.\n\nWeek V — Focus on your sphere of control\n> The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that\nI can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which\nhave to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good\nand evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that\nare my own.~ Epictetus\n * Share a time when you've managed to adjust your approach after realizing you\n   were trying to \"over-control\" a situation, and how that benefited you.\n * Sometimes being successful requires a \"leap of faith\" that perhaps you can\n   control more than you thought possible. How can we embrace ambition without\n   focusing on things outside our control? Or are these two ideas really in\n   tension?\n\nWeek VI — True Wealth\n> Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.~\nEpictetus\n * Are there any physical possessions that you're particularly attached to? How\n   if at all have these attachments limited your freedom or mental health?\n * What are some techniques for limiting our true desires to only what we know\n   will truly bring us fulfillment?","feature_image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucketeer-7bce7cd3-3552-4b4e-8681-9def67f16a7f/2020/07/marcus--1-.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-07-12T23:38:50.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T08:17:37.000Z","published_at":"2020-07-10T23:39:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5f163e11a8c266003b6dea52","uuid":"6e67fb19-470c-4be7-882b-8fb226bd540b","title":"The Wikipedia Effect","slug":"the-wikipedia-effect","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygge\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"/chopins-nocturnes/\"]],[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"A lot of things are deeply strange about having all of human knowledge available at our fingertips.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Our societies are still convulsing over the massive shocks this has had on our cultural and political systems.
