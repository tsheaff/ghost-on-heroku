They're chaotic,\nwhich is giving me a somewhat murky mind.\n\nI've tried freeform journaling in the past, each page a raw stream of\nconsciousness filled with random drawings and doodles and private desires. Right\nnow I'm seeking something more structured to gather my thoughts — hence this new\nblog. A key ingredient for me right now is that these posts will be public,\nwhich will be a forcing function for me to think properly before hitting publish\n, so that this blog is a more structured record of my thoughts about the world.\n\nI plan to cover a broad range of topics. For now, the name of the blog is \nSensatez, a Spanish word meaning sanity and sensibility. I'll be writing about\npolitics, philosophy, science, technology, music, ethics, and other topics on my\nmind. Over time, I may find a groove and narrow the blog's focus somewhat, but\nfor now, Sensatez is a broad mental scaffold to keep my disparate musings from\nclouding my head.","feature_image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucketeer-7bce7cd3-3552-4b4e-8681-9def67f16a7f/2020/07/coffee-eagle-l7HysfP9BPU-unsplash.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-07-12T23:33:39.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T08:19:54.000Z","published_at":"2020-07-05T23:34:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","send_email_when_published":0},{"id":"5f0b9e6276e291001ef8b0a6","uuid":"c5df6b91-56ce-4e2a-a046-ed73e135b58a","title":"Chopin's Nocturnes","slug":"chopins-nocturnes","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gDinVAmtA0\"]],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/content/whitehead-plato\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],0,\"Chopin's \"],[0,[1],2,\"Nocturnes\"],[0,[],0,\" are perfect, pinnacle human expression.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Every art form has its peak output, a work so unparalleled in beauty and form that all other practitioners live in its shadow.

We're 15 years into this social media\nexperiment, and it's not\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump] going\n[https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/17/health/suicide-rates-young-girls-study/index.html] \n particularly\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/social-media-democracy/600763/] \n well [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out], is it?\n\nThe deep divisions and disruptions caused by social media should be a learning\nopportunity for the tech community, to reassess some of their core principles.\nWe need to wrestle with this question:\n\n> Looking forward, how do we avoid such a massive mistake from happening again in\nthe next society-shifting technology innovation — be it Virtual Reality,\nBioengineering, Weaponized Drones, or Artificial Intelligence?\nI don't think anyone knows the answers to this question yet, but we know getting\nit right is of critical importance. The next technology dystopia could be far\nworse than social media — be it an engineered pandemic 100x more deadly than\nCOVID-19\n[https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/viruses101/avian/#:~:text=The%20uncensored%20study%20by%20Fouchier,once%20in%20naturally%20occurring%20H5N1.]\n, or an AI that decides its creator species is more of a nuisance than an aid to\nits ultimate goals.\n\nAvoiding dystopian outcomes with each successive wave of new technology is\nlikely to become harder and harder. The physicists working on the Manhattan\nProject understood the dark implications of their work, but Mark Zuckerberg\nstill seems unwilling to grapple with the real-world consequences of his.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere are a few broad areas we should focus on going forward:\n\nArt is a critical antidote to the excesses of technology. I think Black Mirror\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalhead_(Black_Mirror)] has done more than\nanything else recently to open the world's eyes to the possibility of human\nfrailty to cause deeply disturbing technology futures. We need more art of all\nkinds — music, literature, television, film, sculpture, poetry — to remind us of\nour human fallibility and open our eyes to the possibility for unintended\nconsequences.\n\nTechnology Ethics needs to become more sophisticated, and we need mechanisms to\nbake in better incentives to our technology system. No doubt our social media\necosystem would be far healthier [https://humanetech.com/] if it weren't heavily\nincentivized to maximize time-on-site to serve ads. Governments are struggling\nto solve this problem with existing social-media giants, but in some sense it's\ntoo late. We should have baked better incentives into the structure of our\ntechnologies from the beginning.\n\nTech-forward government is critical for avoiding perverse incentives on the next\ntech frontier. Why is there not a government agency in Washington focused on\nthese issues, and staffed with highly competent technologists? Instead, the only\ntech-forward parts of our government are the organizations like the NSA that are\ntasked with stealing the citizens's private information\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden].\n\nPhilosophy is critical in these challenging times. The maturity of our thinking\naround technology will always be a function of the maturity of the individuals\ninvolved. We need to foster a culture of intellectual maturity, that draws on \nancient [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism] wisdom\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism] rather than thin and immature\nhedonistic \"follow your bliss\" mindsets. I'm heartened by the fact that\nTwitter's CEO Jack Dorsey spends weeks at a time in silent meditation\n[https://www.firstpost.com/health/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-did-silent-vipassana-for-10-days-its-almost-impossible-to-follow-his-schedule-in-everyday-life-7702251.html]\n. I'm glad deep thinkers like Sam Harris\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Harris] and Tristan Harris\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_Harris] are popular among the tech crowd.\nMore of this.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNone of this is easy, but we must keep negotiating this problem before it's too\nlate. Let's become more clear-eyed about human frailty and our increasing power\nof destruction. Let's stop using the term \"disruption\" in the tech community as\nif it's an obvious force for good. Let's each look inward and integrate our own \npotential for destruction [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology)] \nbefore we invent the most powerful technologies in human history.","feature_image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucketeer-7bce7cd3-3552-4b4e-8681-9def67f16a7f/2020/07/restaurant-McDonalds-museum-Ray-Kroc-Illinois-Des--1-.jpg","featured":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-07-12T23:38:21.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-16T05:45:03.000Z","published_at":"2020-07-10T23:38:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"type":"post","send_email_when_published":0},{"id":"5f0b9f0a76e291001ef8b0c6","uuid":"3a4406dd-90ae-4dda-8c90-2d70877476bb","title":"Stoic Circles","slug":"stoic-circles","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism\"]],[\"strong\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"An experiment in community, philosophy and self-improvement\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"We’re living in a time of disconnection and isolation.
